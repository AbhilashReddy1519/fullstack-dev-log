## 📘 About This Course

Welcome to the **MERN Stack Development** course! In this comprehensive learning experience, we dive deep into the world of **full-stack web development** using the powerful and modern MERN stack:

- **MongoDB** – A flexible and scalable NoSQL database.
- **Express.js** – A minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- **React.js** – A versatile JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js** – A JavaScript runtime environment for running code on the server-side.

## 🚀 Why MERN?

The **MERN stack** has gained massive popularity due to its efficiency and developer-friendly ecosystem. Together, these technologies enable the creation of **dynamic**, **interactive**, and **scalable** web applications using **JavaScript across the stack**, both on the client and server.
